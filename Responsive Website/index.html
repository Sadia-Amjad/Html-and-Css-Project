          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within
          a structured institutional framework, such as public schools,
          following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured
          approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while
          informal education entails unstructured learning through daily
          experiences.Formal and non-formal education are categorized into
          levels, including early childhood education, primary education,
          secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications
          focus on teaching methods.

          Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education
          and the provincial governments, while the federal government mostly
          assists in curriculum development, accreditation and the financing of
          research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of Pakistan
          obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education
          to children of the age group 5 to 16 years.</p>

          Female education is a catch-all term for a complex set of issues and
          debates surrounding education (primary education, secondary education,
          tertiary education, and health education in particular) for girls and
          women. It is frequently called girls' education or women's
          education. It includes areas of gender equality and access to
          education. The education of women and girls is important for the
          alleviation of poverty. Broader related topics include scientific
          education and religious education for women, in which education is
          divided along gender lines.
